Hi, my name is Julia. I am 34 and I am from Minsk. A many years ago, 12 years I successfully graduated from the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Electronics. And I have a specialty of engineer in information technology. Still in the 5th year of study I got a job, in a small company specializing in real estate, in the IT department.

Worked with the PHP programming language, first on the basis of the old CodeIgniter framework, and much later studied the Laravel framework. Also worked with MySql database, and with SQL query language. I was a developer of a large internal CRM project, which was a huge database of properties and clients, where realtors and employees of groups and departments had the opportunity to work with them, kept calendars, organizers, electronic contracts and much more. Also developed this company's website, and several small internal projects.
I had knowledge of Html, css, some js (within the old jQuery library mainly), worked with Yandex API....

Later another MLS project was created, which was the database not only for one company, but for several dozens of Real Estate Agencies. This project was already developed on PHP (Laravel) api part, and the frontend on Angular 6 + Bootstrap, and some Git version control.

However, I went on maternity leave in 2019 for family reasons. Then pandemic, birth of twins unfortunately made me quit my job for a long 3 years.....

I knew about RS School courses for a long time and a year ago I registered, first for Stage 0 and successfully finished it, having realized my first adaptive application Library, and at the moment I am going through Stage 1 and have already many interesting realized projects.

All the years of my work there was a big drawback, I think. I didn't have a smart example, a mentor from whom I could learn good practices, good code and beautiful architecture of the project and application. I hope that the smartest, the most beautiful and the most caring mentor will choose me here and help me on my hard way

At this stage of the course I have already received a huge baggage of new and relevant, up-to-date knowledge. And I want to get even more and become a good Frontend, and maybe in the future, full stack developer.
I am a good, responsible and committed team player and can be part of some great company as a developer.
